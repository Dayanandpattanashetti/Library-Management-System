Library Management System

Developed a robust Library Management System using Node.js and Express, incorporating key features:

MongoDB Integration: Established seamless connectivity to a MongoDB database using Mongoose for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Express Middleware: Implemented essential middleware, including rate limiting for enhanced security, compression for optimized performance, and Helmet for content security policy enforcement.

MVC Architecture: Designed an organized and scalable structure following the Model-View-Controller architecture, ensuring maintainability and ease of future development.

EJS View Engine: Utilized the EJS view engine along with express-ejs-layouts for dynamic and modular user interface rendering.

RESTful Routes: Implemented comprehensive RESTful routes for Books, Authors, Genres, and Book Instances, enabling seamless Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.

Error Handling: Implemented effective error handling mechanisms, providing a user-friendly experience in case of unexpected events.

Security Measures: Incorporated content security policies using Helmet, restricting script sources for improved security.

Practice in Rate Limiting: Utilized express-rate-limit to restrict the number of requests per minute, enhancing application security against potential abuse.

Responsive Design: Ensured responsiveness in design for a seamless user experience across various devices.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in web development, emphasizing practical skills in Express, MongoDB, and best practices in building secure and scalable applications.
